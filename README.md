Code built for arduino remote controlled car


The code under control app can be edited to your liking. It has comments for each function describing what they do.
Color modifcation, button layout, and connectivity are all included. 
The app is fully functioning.


The code for the arduino can be edited to your liking. Little sketchy as the bluetooth connectivity I had with 
Adafruits feather dropped connection quite often, but overall works good. Works very well with arduino uno and HCM05 bluetooth adapter.
Again, each line is commented with descriptive detail.


Enjoy
